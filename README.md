In the year 1996, Mark Farina, an American DJ from Chicago, Illinois, created the first of his 8 part mixtapes called Mushroom Jazz. The Mushroom Jazz mixtapes are described as the the perfect comedown solution for nights when the aggressive drum 'n' bass and post-acid techno of the American rave explosion got too overwhelming. Each mixtape is made up of 12-23 songs and the 8 Mushroom Jazz parts were made between 1996 and 2016. It could be very interesting to see what the differences and patterns are between each of the Mushroom Jazz volume's.

The mixtapes contain elements of different genres such as downtempo, hip hop, jazz, R&B, French, Latin. Songs can be compared on that front. It could also be interesting to compare artists and the populairity of the songs used in each volume. There could be a big difference there, as some of the songs have their own Wikipedia page and others don't.

There is a small problem with this Corpus however, because there are some songs missing on Spotify. Of the 148 total tracks, 114 are available on the platform. This means that 34 tracks are missing. Test of dit werkt?
